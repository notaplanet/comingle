    You can see the frames in Comingle.  (If you can't see them, enable cookies and turn off blockers).
    You can access the Google spreadsheets. Our team list is notaplanet-active@googlegroups.com, and membership on this new list is required to access our Google docs. (If you got this email but can't access the sheets, sign-in to sheets with the same email, or sign up again with the correct email address.)
    You can access Slack from the buttons on Comingle (e.g. #general chat at left and Room chat at right for puzzles). (If you can't, check that your Chrome extension is installed). We use slack (notaplanet.slack.com) for chat. This year each puzzle's slack channel will be available under Room Chat on the right of each room.  If you didn't receive a notaplanet Slack invitation, please email me.

    <h4>Shift Captain Duties</h4>
The shift captain is the first point of contact for minor questions or problems:
​
    The main responsibility is to make sure that people are signed up for events or other time-sensitive actions. It is recommended to also use slack's "reminder" feature, e.g.:
​
/remind #general "The Towers of Hanoi event is starting in 30 minutes" at 2:30pm
​
    If any problem comes up that you can't handle, notify the command team.
    Any new puzzles should be scraped from the hunt website by Ceres within 3-5 minutes. If this is not working, manually inform Ceres about any new puzzles (and let the tech team know!). First, type "@Ceres help" in slack to get a reminder of the syntax. (If you don't get a reply, then Ceres is off!) Then use the newpuzzle command to create a new puzzle, e.g.:
​
@Ceres newpuzzle "Wizardry" "The Towers of Hanoi" https://mitmh23.com/wizardry/hanoi
​
    This command will automatically create Google sheets, comingle room, slack channel, etc. within about 3 minutes.
    Sometimes there are special events or other sorts of puzzles that don't have a dedicated page on the official MH website: you can use the newpuzzle command for such circumstances. Note that the url for each puzzle must be unique.
